# (PART) Workshop 2:  Data Wrangling with Hub Search & ohvbd {-}

# Introduction


## Learning objectives

**By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:**

1. Use VBD Hub resources to access shared VBD datasets.
2. Effectively wrangle real-world VDB datasets ready for further analysis.
3. Build collaborative, professional connections within the VBD community.


## Prerequisites

**Before participating in this workshop, you should have:**

- Foundational knowledge of programming in R and RStudio, including running code, installing packages, and working within scripts.
- Some experience of formatting datasets in R, such as importing .csv files and viewing dataframes.
- Basic understanding of VBD biology, including common vectors and pathogen transmission.


## Training Plan
### Pre- live session content
This is to be completed ahead of the Live Session.
Content will be available on the Hub under Learning Resources.
The VBD Hub Forum is available for support and networking.


### Live session
10:00 - 13:00 on Thursday 26th March, via Teams.
Content will be made available on the Hub under Learning Resources on the day of the Live Session.


### Post- Live Session Challenge Task
Multi-stage task to be completed independently after the Live Session. The stages will increase in difficulty and provide an opportunity to apply what you have learnt to real VBD datasets.
Content will be posted on the Hub under Learning Resources on the day of the Live Session.
The VBD Hub Forum will be available for support and networking).


## Navigating Course Content
Many of the tasks in this workshop will be in a workbook-style format and will walk you through how to code specific functions and models. We encourage you to type this code yourself to practice syntax and gain the most out of the content provided, rather than copying and pasting.


All coding through this workshop will be done in Rstudio, a user friendly IDE (integrated development environment) for R language. Please ensure you have R and RStudio installed and updated ahead of the Live Session. If you do not already have R or RStudio installed, see here.


## Available Materials & Support
If you need a quick reminder of basic coding in R, additional materials and cheat sheets can be found here:

- Basic R syntax & functions
- Data wrangling (read up to Data visualization)
- Basic hypothesis testing
-	Basic R cheatsheet
-	Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr cheatsheet


If you need additional support through this workshop:

- The [**Forum**](http://forum.vbdhub.org) is a good place to discuss queries with fellow participants.
- Demonstrators will be available to help during the **Live Session**.
- During the **Challenge Task**, a specific discussion on the Forum will be open to ask demonstrators questions. One-to-one video support will also be available if required.
- For technical support (e.g. trouble accessing content or joining the Teams link), please contact (email). This is **not** for coding or statistical support.


## Installing Packages
This workshop will use several R packages throughout, please install these ahead of the **Live Session**.


**Packages for this workshop:**
(to be added when coding tasks)


::: {.rmdtip}
**Reminder:** To install packages in R, use the `install.packages()` command.
:::

To install one package:
``` r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

To install multiple packages:
``` r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
```

An example of loading data: 

<!--@chloe You can incorporate code to be run at render time here.
Note: it's best to have as little work as possible for the server to do, so we'll mostly be getting people to use local data.-->

Task - access a specific dataset with ohvbd (Francis’ vignettes)


### Forum
Forum - what is this and how to use it


Task - introduce yourself on the Forum


## Data Wrangling Principles
Wide to long, check data type


Example task


## Form (ahead of the live session)
Did you access the datasets?


What types of data?


Data wrangling Q


# Live Session


## Schedule
10:00 - Introduction
10:10 - Recap Pre- Live Session Content
10:20 - Data Wrangling (Broad)
10:25 - Replicate/Merging
10:40 - Fix Species Name
11:00 - BREAK
11:10 - Real-World Data is Messy

## Introduction (10 mins)
Introduce myself


Introduce demonstrators


Recap Learning Objectives


Reiterate where to find support:
Forum
Demonstrators
Technical difficulties - (email)


## Recap Pre- Live Session Content (10 mins)
What went well?


Common mistakes


Strong anonymous examples?


## Data Wrangling (Broad) (5 mins)
Lots of ways to wrangle data, depends on field, data collected, etc.


We will focus on two methods key to VBD data.


## Replicate/Merging (15 mins)
Similar columns across two datasets


Merge by common column


Useful functions


Common mistakes


## Fix Species Name (20 mins)
Find and remove a misnamed species


Remove underscore or spp. Etc. at the end of the species name


Make a column all lowercase


Useful functions


Common mistakes


Combine merging - merge by species


RGBIF for those wanting extra


## Real World Data is Messy (15 mins)
Common trip-ups in “messy” data sets


What to look out for


## Collaborative Task (45 mins)
Find a specified dataset through ohvbd


Identify what makes it messy


Wrangle data


Try to use datasets with multiple messy elements:
Mixed data types
Messy columns (merge)
Messy species names
Wide to long


## Share Results from Collaborative Task (15 mins)
4 groups


What went wrong?


How did you fix it?


Why?


## What Does Collaboration Mean to You? (15 minutes)
Why do you want to collaborate?


What makes a good collaboration?


What makes a bad collaboration?


How could you use the Forum in your own research context for collaboration?


Whiteboard


## Prepare for Challenge Task & Conclusion (10 mins)
Outline Challenge Task


Where to find support


Conclusion


# Challenge Task


## Level 1
Find a dataset using Hub Search or VBD Hub (participant choice)


## Level 2
What data types?


Does it need converting from wide to long?


## Level 3
Do any columns need merging? (second dataset? TBC?)


## Level 4
Check species names


Variable/trait names?


## Level 5
Share your wrangling process in the Forum, feedback to each other


You might choose to pair up with someone using similar data and give peer feedback
